# A List in Python is one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures. It acts like a dynamic container that can hold multiple items in a specific order.
# Think of a list like a shopping list or a to-do list: it has an order, you can add new items to it, cross items off, or change them.

# A built in data type that set of value .
# it can store elemennt of diffrence types (interger , float, string ,etc .)

mark = [10,20,30,40,50]
print (mark)
print(type(mark))
print (mark[0])
print (len(mark))

# mark = [10,20,30,40]    # mark [0] = 10  and mark = [1] = 20


# NOTE - STRING ARE IMMUTABLE 
# NOTE - LIST ARE MUTABLE MEAN CHANGE KAR SKATE HAI 

# list Slicing 
# list_name [starting _idx: ending _idx]


mark = [65,75,85,95]
print(mark[0:3])
print(mark[-3:-1])
