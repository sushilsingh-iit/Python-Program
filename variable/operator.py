# 1. Arithmetic Operators

# Used for mathematical calculations.

# Operator	Meaning	Example
# +	Addition	10 + 5 = 15
# -	Subtraction	10 - 5 = 5
# *	Multiplication	10 * 5 = 50
# /	Division	10 / 5 = 2.0
# %	Modulus (remainder)	10 % 3 = 1
# **	Exponent (power)	2 ** 3 = 8
# //	Floor division	10 // 3 = 3


a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)
print(a // b)




# 2. Comparison (Relational) Operators

# Used to compare two values (returns True or False).

# Operator	Meaning
# ==	Equal to
# !=	Not equal to
# >	Greater than
# <	Less than
# >=	Greater than or equal
# <=	Less than or equal


c = 10
d = 5
print(c > d)
print(c == d)

# 3. Logical Operators

# Used to combine conditional statements.

# Operator	Meaning
# and	True if both conditions are true
# or	True if at least one condition is true
# not	Reverses the result

x = 10
y = 5
print(x > 5 and y < 10)
print(not(x == 10))
